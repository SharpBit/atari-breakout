# Atari Breakout
Our final project for FCPS 2018. Our goal was to recreate Atari Breakout. We used [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to create the game.

### How to Play
Run main.py. If you want, you can toggle sound and music in options (top left), or click start. Move the paddle to catch the ball and break all the bricks. To exit the game, press ESC and click quit.

### Note
This application gets your monitor's resolution. If for some reason you don't want the program to get your resolution, then don't use this program.
